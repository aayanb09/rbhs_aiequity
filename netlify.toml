# Netlify Configuration
# NOTE: Netlify does not support Flask applications natively.
# This file is for reference only. Consider using:
# - Render (current deployment)
# - Railway
# - Heroku
# - Fly.io

# If you want to use Netlify, you would need to:
# 1. Convert to a static site with serverless functions
# 2. Or use Netlify as CDN and keep backend on Render

[build]
  # This won't work for Flask - Netlify needs static files or serverless functions
  publish = "static"
  command = "echo 'Flask apps require a traditional server. Please use Render, Railway, or Heroku instead.'"

# Environment variables would go here if this were supported
# [context.production.environment]
#   CLARIFAI_PAT = "your-key"
#   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-key"
